# Receipt OCR
In this project, we aim to use existing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, such as Tesseract (https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) to extract text from receipt images. Once the text is extracted, we apply Named Entity Recognition (NER), a part of Natural Language Processing (NLP), using tools like spaCy (https://spacy.io/) classify important information into predefined categories relevant to receipts. These categories include details like merchant names, dates, and total amounts, allowing us to efficiently organize and analyse receipt data.
